# How to Use Nuvin During a Panic Attack

Panic attacks can feel overwhelming, but having a reliable tool at your fingertips can make all the difference. Nuvin was designed specifically for moments like these—when you need immediate, effective relief. Here's exactly how to use the app when panic strikes.

## Understanding Panic Attacks

First, let's clarify what you're experiencing. A panic attack typically involves:

- Rapid heartbeat or palpitations
- Shortness of breath or feeling like you can't breathe
- Chest tightness or pain
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Trembling or shaking
- Intense fear or sense of impending doom
- Hot flashes or chills
- Nausea

**Important:** Panic attacks are not dangerous, even though they feel terrifying. Your body is in fight-or-flight mode, but you are safe.

## Step 1: Hit the SOS Button

When panic starts, the most important thing is to act quickly—before the panic spiral intensifies.

1. **Open Nuvin** - The app launches directly to your dashboard
2. **Tap the large red SOS button** - This is prominently displayed on your home screen
3. **The app immediately activates** - No menus to navigate, no decisions to make

**Why this matters:** During a panic attack, decision-making is impaired. The SOS button removes all friction—one tap gets you immediate help.

## Step 2: Follow the Breathing Guide

After tapping SOS, Nuvin automatically launches a breathing exercise (box breathing by default). Here's what to do:

1. **Watch the visual guide** - A circle expands and contracts, showing you when to breathe
2. **Follow along** - Breathe in sync with the visual
3. **Feel the haptic feedback** - Your phone vibrates gently to guide your rhythm
4. **Focus only on the screen** - Let everything else fade into the background

**The rhythm:**
- Breathe IN for 4 seconds (circle expands)
- HOLD for 4 seconds (circle pauses)
- Breathe OUT for 4 seconds (circle contracts)
- HOLD for 4 seconds (circle pauses)

**Pro tip:** Even if it feels impossible at first, try to match just one breath cycle. Then another. Within 2-3 minutes, your nervous system will start to calm.

## Step 3: Add Grounding (If Needed)

If breathing alone isn't enough, Nuvin offers a quick transition to grounding:

1. **Tap "Add Grounding"** (appears after 2 minutes of breathing)
2. **Follow the 5-4-3-2-1 prompts** - The app guides you through each sense
3. **Take your time** - There's no rush, engage with each prompt fully

**Why combine them:** Breathing calms your nervous system, while grounding anchors you in the present. Together, they're incredibly powerful.

## Step 4: Use the Physical Reset (Optional)

Sometimes panic creates physical tension that needs release. Nuvin includes simple movement exercises:

1. **Shake it out** - Follow the guided shaking exercise (15-30 seconds)
2. **Muscle tension/release** - Tense and release major muscle groups
3. **Posture reset** - Stand tall, roll shoulders back, ground your feet

**When to use:** If you feel "locked up" or if your muscles are extremely tense.

## What to Do After the Panic Subsides

Once the acute panic has passed (usually 5-15 minutes):

1. **Log your mood** - Nuvin's mood tracker helps you identify patterns
2. **Note any triggers** - What happened right before the attack?
3. **Be kind to yourself** - Panic attacks are exhausting. Rest is important.
4. **Review your progress** - See how you've handled previous attacks

## Tips for Using Nuvin Effectively

### Before a Panic Attack

**Set up the app when you're calm:**
- Customize your SOS settings
- Try each exercise so they're familiar
- Add Nuvin to your home screen for quick access
- Enable offline mode (no internet required)

### During a Panic Attack

**Remember:**
- You don't have to do anything "perfectly"
- Even partial engagement helps
- It's okay to repeat exercises
- The panic will pass—Nuvin helps it pass faster

### After a Panic Attack

**Track and learn:**
- Log the attack in your mood tracker
- Note what helped most
- Adjust your SOS settings if needed
- Review patterns over time

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I can't follow the breathing rhythm?**
A: That's completely normal at first. Try to match just the exhale. Even slowing your exhale slightly activates your parasympathetic nervous system.

**Q: Can I use Nuvin if I'm in public?**
A: Absolutely. You can turn off sound and just follow the visual guide. You can also excuse yourself to a restroom or quiet space.

**Q: What if the panic attack doesn't stop?**
A: Most panic attacks peak within 10 minutes. Keep using the techniques. If symptoms persist for more than 30 minutes or if you have chest pain, seek medical attention.

**Q: Should I use Nuvin every time I feel anxious?**
A: Yes! Nuvin works for both full panic attacks and general anxiety. Regular practice also builds resilience.
